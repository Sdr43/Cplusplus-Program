# CPLUSPLUS-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
The project ABCHashTable is based an application for reading a file on courses for college students. So that they can look at sample courses
and get an idea what they want to take. The process in writing this code was somewhat difficult, I used a hashtable file loader from a previous
assignment and altered it to my liking with the help from some websites such as cplusplus.com and geeksforgeeks.com to give me the right commands
needed for it.

# What did you do particularly well?
I would say that the best thing I did great on was using my creativity on altering an existing assignment with just some minor changes and adding a few
more to make it look good. At first, I couldn't figure out what approach to go with butt then I thought of this and I knew that it was the right path.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvememnts make your code efficient, secure, etc.?
The place where I could enhance it would be if I were to add more files in searching course data such as a more in depth look to each one.
Just give it more information and with these adjustments would help the user in his decision making a lot better.

# Did you find writing any piece of this coding challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The challenging parts would be searching for that specific code to make it all run. As I mentioned earlier, if I needed help I looked towards cplusplus.com and
geeksforgeeks.com as resources to help with this project. I do have to say that some pieces came to thought that worked beautifully.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The main that you could take from this would be some of the base places that was needed for loops and the menu making any file run correctly. To be honest, 
anything from this could be used or implemented for any use because every piece can be manipulated/changed for the greater good of coding.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
How I was able to keep this coding maintainable was appling industry standard best practices in explaining my work. I believe when reading this code 
and that you can understand coding you knew where I was going with it.
