# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project that I uploaded is about calculating banking investments that involves interests, deposits and annual outcomes.
The problems I had in coding this was that I forgot about the fixed << setpercision(2) for the decimal places and making sure I had the right calculation
for the end of year output.

# What did you do particularly well?
What I did particuarly well was probably explaining my coding as I went along and spacing

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The only thing I can think of to enhance it would be to add another language to it that expand other parts of the bank like investers, businesses and others
that contribute to the banks funds and give it that user friendly adaptability.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
In the other comment under problems was trying to find the right coding for the fixed and some math too. The tools i used for this was the www.cplusplus.com
for anything I needed to know.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
So, what can you take away from this project to use on others would be in main with the variables and to make sure when dealing with decimals it is wise to use 
double, the math needed for the calculation and the for loop that was used with in the mathematics.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
How I made this maintainable was from my previous courses and knew what was expected in the them to make my work look better. That expierence helped me to adapted
to C++ even greater, so that the work I do here will be easly readable and well typed. Also, practice makes perfect.
